Project Rat Heros

My Response to the CodeClan assignment on day 26:

JS Constructor Lab

The task is to test drive the beginnings of an adventure game.

In pairs ...

A.

    Create a constructor to create a Hero character.
        A Hero has a name
        A Hero has health
        A Hero has a favourite food
        A Hero can talk saying their name

B.

    Create a food constructor.
        Food should have a name
        Food should have a replenishment value

C.

    A hero should be able to eat food, and health should go up by the replenishment value
    If the food is their favourite food, their health should go up by 1.5 * value.

Further. D.

    Create a Rat constructor
    Rats should be able to touch food, if they do the food becomes poisonous.
    Heroes that eat poisonous food should lose health.

E. Be creative. Extend the game! Give the hero super powers. Bring a baddy into it who takes over the world.
